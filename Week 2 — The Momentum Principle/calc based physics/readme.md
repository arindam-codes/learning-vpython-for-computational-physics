# WEEK 1 — FULL KINEMATICS + VECTORS + 2D MOTION MASTERY

**Textbook: Serway & Jewett**

---

## 🔴 RULES (READ ONCE)

* Problems first, theory only when stuck
* If a problem feels easy → it **doesn’t count**
* No memorized formulas
* Graphs + diagrams are mandatory
* Post-mortem after every problem

### ✅ CHAPTER 4 DONE IF:

* You instinctively separate components
* Frames of reference feel like **tools**, not tricks

# 🧠 POST-MORTEM TEMPLATE (USE FOR EVERY PROBLEM)

```
1. What assumption was punished?
2. What quantity stayed invariant?
3. What representation unlocked the solution?
4. How would this generalize to 2D / 3D / non-inertial frames?
```
